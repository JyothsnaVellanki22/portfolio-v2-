                    I’m a developer who loves building clean, intuitive, high-performance web applications—where seamless user experience meets strong engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love working at the point where front-end polish, backend architecture, and emerging AI technologies come together to create applications that feel seamless, reliable, and genuinely enjoyable to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve developed software applications across a wide range of environments — from large retail ecosystems — contributing to end-to-end solutions involving Angular interfaces, FastAPI and Flask microservices, PostgreSQL data models, and cloud-native deployments. I’ve also designed and built an AI-powered chatbot from the ground up, owning everything from the conversation UI and component architecture to backend retrieval pipelines, vector stores, embeddings, and LLM integrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring new AI tools, designing small UI concepts, improving my full-stack projects, or deepening my knowledge in system design and cloud architecture. I love solving problems, building delightful digital experiences, and constantly pushing myself to become a stronger engineer.
